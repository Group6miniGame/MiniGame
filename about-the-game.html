            <h2>Game Strategies</h2>
            <p>While Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game, players can still develop strategies to improve their chances of
                winning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control the center:</strong> Always try to place your mark in the center square, as it gives
                    you the most opportunities for winning.</li>
                <li><strong>Block your opponent:</strong> Always look out for potential winning combinations for your
                    opponent, and block them if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Forking:</strong> Create two opportunities to win, forcing your opponent to block one while you
                    win with the other.</li>
                <li><strong>Play for a draw:</strong> If you're behind, try to force a draw by blocking your opponentâ€™s
                    winning moves.</li>
            </ul>
